    <H1>PROJECT SUMMARY</H1>
    <P>I redesigned an existing website for a Chinese restaurant in Seattle. Currently, Shanghai Garden has a long scrolling single page website that is difficult to navigate, with hard-to-read menu items.</P>

    <P>Navigation items snap down the page when clicked and it is unclear where a user is on the page after clicking a navigation item.</P>

    <P>To give the customer a better shopping experience, the redesign creates easy to navigate pages, updated content, and an online checkout delivery option. This was done by adding additional pages to separate content, adding reviews from social media, and updating menu categories done by using a card sort. An online ordering page was added for to-go orders with an easy checkout process.</p>

    <h1>PROBLEM & GOAL</h1>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<P>Consumers had a difficult time navigating the website as well as reading menu items. Consumers could not order online or order delivery.</P>

<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>Redesign the website so that consumers will be able to navigate the site more easily and read the menu items with ease. Add additional features the persona desired for a more fun shopping experience.</p>

<p>Primary goals for the redesign included:<br>
more compelling imagery
a delivery and pickup order option
organized menu for easily digestible content
the removal of advertisements</p>

<p>Secondary goals are to design new pages with more in-depth information on location, about the restaurant, and a modern home page with reviews and pictures of popular food items.</p>

<h1>CONTENT</h1>

<h2>Current Design</h2>
<p>Some issues with the current website are:<br>
The menu has visibility issues
The menu is really long and there are too many headlines
The ads are distracting and confusing showing ads for other restaurants
The nav bar at the top scrolls down to the item instead of going to another page
It is difficult or impossible to know where you are on the web page as there are no indicators</p>
    
<img class="image" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/OldNavigation.png" alt="Shanghai Gardens old navigation" style="width:55%">

<p class="p4">Tiny navigation items that snap down the page when clicked.</p>

<img class="image" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/OldMenuAds.png" alt="Shanghai Gardens section of website for menu with advertisements" style="width:55%">

<p class="p4">It is unclear what is going on here. These must be ads in place over the menu.</p>

<img class="image" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/OldMenu.png" alt="Shanghai Gardens menus in picture format" style="width:55%">

<p class="p4">Menu is in picture format and extremely hard to read. Clicking on the menu items takes the customer to an enlarged view on another page with more ads.</p>

<h2>New Design</h2>

<img class="image" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/SecondGifHome.gif" alt="Shanghai new home page design GIF" style="width:60%">

<p class="p3">The home page shows compelling imagery with social media reviews and an easy to read navigation.</p>

<img class="image" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/ThirdGifMenu.gif" alt="Shangai exploring the new menu design GIF" style="width:60%">

<p class="p3">The menu pages have a list of menu items and prices instead of a PDF or JPEG image.</p>

<img class="image" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/FourthGifOrder.gif" alt="Shanghai Gardens completing an online pickup order walk through GIF" style="width:60%">

<p class="p3">You can order items, add additional quantities and have your meal delivered to you.</p>


<h1>RESEARCH: HOW I GOT THERE</h1>

<h2>Competitive Feature Analysis</h2>

<img class="image1" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/CompetitiveAnalysis.png" alt="Competitive analysis of Shanghai Gardens compared to King Noodle, Tai Tung Chinese Restaurant, Duk Li Dim Sum, Din Tai Fung, and Green Leaf Vietnamese Restaurant" style="width:55%">

<H3>Synthesis</H3>
<p>There were some basic items missing from the Shanghai Garden website such as an about page, reviews of their restaurant, online ordering, and compelling pictures on their homepage. These would be added into the final design of the website.</p>

<h2>Personas</h2>
<p>After interviewing six participants (two consumers of Shanghai Gardens and four restaurant consumers), I came up with the following personas: Juan and Janet.</p>

<img class="image1" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/PersonaAV2.png" alt="Persona Juan" style="width:55%; padding:20px 0px 20px 0px;">
<bR>
<img class="image1" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/PersonaBV2.png" alt="Persona Janet" style="width:55%; padding:20px 0px;">

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Grouping themes and ideas from the personas and competitor websites, I sketched out ideas for the pages of the website. I got inspiration on designs from Imjai Thai in Portland, Din Tai Fung, King Noodle, and Green Leaf Vietnamese Restaurant.</p>

<h2 style="padding-top:4%">Card Sort of Menu Categories</h2>

<p>Since the menu seemed confusing, I created a card sort using common items. The result was the original menu items were condensed from 15 items to nine items. The new menu became more predictable and easy to navigate for the consumer.</p>


<ul style="list-style-type:none; margin:4% 0% 0% 11.4%; padding: 0%;color:#1B3F73; font-size:2.0vw; font-family:Nimbus">
    <li style="float:left; padding-right:18.2%;">Current Menu</li>
    <li >After Card Sort</li>

</ul>

<h1>USER TESTING</h1>

<p>I tested six participants on navigating the website and completing a delivery order for five specific items. I asked that they give details on their feelings of using the site, anything that caught their attention, and anything that was confusing and could be updated.</p>

    
<img src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/HomePageCallOutV3_3.jpg" alt="Home page final design iteration with updates from usability test" style="width:65%; margin:4% 0% 0% 10%">

<p class="Shanghai-text-CallOut">Headlines were added to the home page to signify what a person was looking at and to show separation of items on the page. Social media reviews were changed to the original size from the respective websites for consistency, predictability, and visibility.</p>
    
<img src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/MenuCallOutV3_2.jpg" alt="Menu page final design with additions" style="width:73.4%; margin:6% 0% 0% 10%">

<p class="Shanghai-text-CallOut">To prevent a long scrolling menu page with dozens of pictures per category, the menu items were changed from pictures to text with pricing for easy to find items.</p>
    
<img src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/MyOrderCallOutV3-01.jpg" alt="Order page final design with updates from usability test" style="width:68%; margin:6% 0% 0% 10%">

<p class="Shanghai-text-CallOut">Titles were added to the menu items and order box. The tested version gave participants the impression that the menu items in the middle were the items that were already on their order.</p>

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

<p>Participants in the user testing were pleased with the new design and had an easy time ordering items. The new design hits on key goals and needs of Juan and Janet, such as easy to read menus, take out and delivery ordering, social media information, and appealing imagery. It also assists in some pain points for Juan and Janet to be able to read the menu and order quickly.</p>

<p>The navigation is intuitive and illustrates the section the user has chosen on the website, while the footer provides helpful information.</p>

<p style="clear:right">To finalize the product, I would do an additional user test and collaborate with developers and other stakeholders before launching the product.</p>
